## Practice_Repo1
This is my first repository using Github. It will be used to get familiar with
working with Github and repositories.

## Overview 
This repo is meant to be exploratory and the goal is to create a repo to get a
basic understanding of working with repos in GitHub. There is no formal project
for this repo. We are not working with any data. We are using this repo to
understand the elements of repos and GitHub. 

## Plan
1. Make a repo
2. Make commits with good commit messages
3. Use branches
4. Create a README.md file as cover page
5. using the issues feature

## Organization
This will have a simple organization and all files being used will be found
on the top level without any sub-folders.
